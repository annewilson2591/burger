## Description ##
Eat-Da-Burger demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front-end implemented with HTML/CSS and elements of Bootstrap and backend implemented with node.js and express.

In this app, the user enters a burger to be added to the menu. Once submitted, the burger is added to the MySQL database and listed under 'New Burgers'. The user may then eat the burger, moving it to the adjacent 'Devoured Burgers' column and updating the status in the database accordingly.
